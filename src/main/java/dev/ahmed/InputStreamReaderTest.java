/**
 * Processing stream two: the use of conversion flow
     *1. Conversion stream: belongs to the character stream
         * InputStreamReader: Convert a byte input stream to a character input stream
         * OutputStreamWriter: Convert a character output stream to a byte output stream

     * 2. Function: Provide conversion between byte stream and character stream

     * 3. Decoding: byte, byte array ---> character array, string
        * Encoding: chararray, string ---> byte, bytearray

    * 4. Character set

     ASCII: American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
            It can be represented by 7 bits of a byte.
     ISO8859-1: Latin code table. Eurocode
            Represented by 8 bits of a byte.
     GB2312: Chinese code table for China. Up to two bytes encode all characters
     GBK: China's Chinese code table has been upgraded to incorporate more Chinese characters and symbols.
            Up to two byte encoding
     Unicode: International Standard Code, which combines all the characters currently used by humans.
            Assign a unique character code to each character. All text is represented by two bytes.
     UTF-8: A variable-length encoding method, which can represent a character with 1-4 bytes.
